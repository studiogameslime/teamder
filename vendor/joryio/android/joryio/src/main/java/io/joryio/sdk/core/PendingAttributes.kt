/**
 * Attributes written by the app that the server has not acknowledged yet.
 *
 * `setAttributes` used to POST fire-and-forget: on failure it logged and
 * dropped the value. An attribute set while offline never reached the server at
 * all, and because the in-app sync path ALSO carried attributes and let them
 * override the stored profile, in-app targeting still looked right - so the
 * loss was invisible everywhere it mattered (segments, journeys, email).
 *
 * Events have had a durable at-least-once queue with retry since the
 * beginning. Attributes had nothing. This closes that gap.
 *
 * ## Why in-memory and not disk, unlike events
 *
 * The SDK deliberately keeps attributes off durable storage - [IdentityManager]
 * holds them in memory only, because they are PII. A disk-backed retry queue
 * would put exactly that PII at rest.
 *
 * It would also preserve a write whose source of truth is already gone: if the
 * process dies the in-memory attribute dies with it, so a queued copy would
 * outlive the value it represents. In-memory retry matches the lifetime of the
 * data it retries - the correct durability level here, not a compromise.
 *
 * What this does fix is the case that actually loses data in practice: the app
 * is running, the network is not, and the value is dropped for good.
 *
 * ## Second job: the un-acked set IS the dirty set
 *
 * [pending] is what the in-app sync request sends. Only attributes the server
 * has not confirmed need to ride that request; everything else is already in
 * the profile and the server should read its own copy. That turns the sync
 * payload from "everything the device believes" into "the little the server
 * might not know yet", which is what makes server-authoritative targeting safe.
 *
 * Mirrors `PendingAttributes.swift`.
