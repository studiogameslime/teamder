/**
 * In-app campaign, as `/v1/in-app/sync` actually returns it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE WAS REWRITTEN
 * ---------------------------
 * The previous version modelled a STRUCTURED native message - `title`, `body`,
 * `imageUrl`, `buttons` - nested under a `message` object. The server has never
 * sent that. It sends `template { html, css, assets }` (plus `renderedHtml`
 * when Liquid personalisation is on), because the campaign editor is HTML-based
 * and produces HTML. There was no `message` key in the payload at all, so
 * in-app messaging did not partially work on Android - it could not work.
 *
 * WHY HTML AND NOT NATIVE VIEWS
 * -----------------------------
 * Mature platforms offer both: Braze ships native slideup/modal/full types
 * alongside an HTML type; CleverTap the same. Both are worth having, and the
 * split is the right end state - native renders faster and looks like the host
 * app, HTML gives designers full control.
 *
 * But nothing in this product AUTHORS structured content today. Building a
 * native renderer before the editor can produce native templates would be dead
 * code shipped to every customer. So HTML is the content type now, and
 * [InAppContent] is a sealed type rather than a bare string: adding
 * [InAppContent.Native] later is additive, not a rewrite of everything that
 * touches a message.
