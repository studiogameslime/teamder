/**
 In-app campaign, as `/v1/in-app/sync` actually returns it.

 WHY THIS FILE WAS REWRITTEN
 ---------------------------
 The previous version modelled a STRUCTURED native message - `title`, `body`,
 `imageUrl`, `buttons` - nested under a `message` object. The server has never
 sent that. It sends `template { html, css, assets }` (plus `renderedHtml` when
 Liquid personalisation is on), because the campaign editor is HTML-based and
 produces HTML. There was no `message` key in the payload at all, so decoding
 could not succeed: in-app messaging was not degraded on iOS, it was inert.

 WHY HTML AND NOT NATIVE VIEWS
 -----------------------------
 Mature platforms offer both - Braze ships native slideup/modal/full types
 alongside an HTML type, CleverTap likewise - and that split is the right end
 state. But nothing in this product AUTHORS structured content today, so a
 native renderer would be dead code shipped to every customer. `InAppContent`
 is therefore an enum rather than a bare string: adding a `.native` case later
 is additive instead of a rewrite of every call site.
