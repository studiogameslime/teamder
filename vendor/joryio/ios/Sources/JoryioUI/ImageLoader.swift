/**
 The smallest image loader that does the job, deliberately.

 An SDK adding SDWebImage or Kingfisher imposes that dependency, and its
 version, on every integrating app. For one optional image in an in-app message
 that is a poor trade, so this is URLSession plus an NSCache.

 Behaviour that matters:
 - **https only.** An in-app image URL is authored content; http would let a
   campaign trigger cleartext traffic, which ATS blocks by default anyway.
 - **Fails invisibly.** A failed load HIDES the image view rather than leaving a
   blank 140dp gap in the middle of the message.
 - **Tag-checked.** The view records which URL it asked for, so a late response
   cannot paint over a message the user has already dismissed.
