/**
 The presenter the base SDK finds when `JoryioUI` is linked.

 Base looks this class up BY NAME (`JoryioUI.DefaultInAppMessagePresenter`) via
 `NSClassFromString` and calls the no-argument initialiser, so **the module
 name, the class name and `init()` are public API between the two products**.
 Renaming any of them is a breaking change no compiler will catch - it would
 simply stop displaying messages, in silence. Change base's lookup in the same
 commit, or not at all.

 `@objc` and the `NSObject` base are required for that lookup: Swift-only types
 are invisible to the Objective-C runtime, and `NSClassFromString` would return
 nil for them.
